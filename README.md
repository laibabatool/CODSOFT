TASK 01: Titanic survivors prediction
This notebook describes the first task of the Codsoft Data Science internship, which is to use the Titanic dataset to predict which passengers survived the disaster. Five different machine learning models were used to make predictions, and the accuracy of each model was compared using the accuracy_score metric.
