#Data Science Projects
Project 01: Titanic Survivors Prediction
This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset to predict which passengers survived the disaster. Five different machine learning models were implemented, and their performance was evaluated using the accuracy_score metric.

Project 02: Credit Card Fraud Detection
Built a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Techniques for handling imbalanced datasets were applied. Model performance was assessed using f1_score, precision, and recall.

Project 03: Iris Flower Classification
Demonstrated the process of data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation to classify Iris flowers into their respective species using machine learning algorithms.
