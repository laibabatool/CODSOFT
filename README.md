TASK 01: Titanic survivors prediction
This notebook describes the first task of the Codsoft Data Science internship, which is to use the Titanic dataset to predict which passengers survived the disaster. Five different machine learning models were used to make predictions, and the accuracy of each model was compared using the accuracy_score metric.

TASK 02: Credit Card Fraud Detection
Developed a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions, employing techniques to handle imbalanced datasets. f1_score , precision and recall score were use to check the accuracy of the model prediction.
